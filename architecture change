Client creates a question using the ui.
A question can look like:

{
  id
  title: String
  Options: [
   {
    text: String
    correct: Bool
   }
  ]
  Styling: {

  }
}

Using POST server/api/question

Question is saved to the DB

and return to the client the id of the newly saved question

The user see: `www.guysServer.com/htmls/${ id }`
so he can copy it to EDX

The server, when receiving /htmls/:id will render an hbs view, according to data he fetches from DB using the id.
